### Features
User Authorization and Login – Users will be able to create their own account.

Create Inventory – Users will have the ability to create and modify their own inventory.  

Search Function – Users can search through the inventory they create to find items quickly.

### Technologies

Spring Boot

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will be learning the Angular framework and JavaScript front-end for this project.
